# Plan your maintenance area {#autocharging-planning status=beta}

We highly recommend that the maintenance area fulfills the specifications of Duckietown. If needed, U-turns can be used.

Charging modules are scalable structures. Under good light conditions, roughly $3$ Duckiebots fit in one tile. To ensure robustness, multiple charging modules should be used - that way, if a Duckiebot gets stuck for any reason, the affected charging module can be closed while all others can still be used.

## Decide how many Duckiebots need to fit

Charging of a Duckiebot takes roughly the same time as discharging it. However, currently there is no way to park Duckiebots. Therefore it is recommended to be able to fit every Duckiebot inside the charging area.

## Calculate the amount of charging rail tiles

$ ChargingTiles = \frac{Duckiebots}{3}$



## Plan the charging area

**In between an intersection and a charging rail tile, there needs to be at least one straight.**

The charging area in ([](#fig:charging_area_example)) fulfills the specifications and has four chargers (two per module).
