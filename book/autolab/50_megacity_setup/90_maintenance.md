# Maintenance of the charging area {#autocharging-maintenance status=beta}

The Tram charging solution needs to be maintained to ensure a robust charging procedure.

## Clean the contacts

The brass rails from the charging rail tiles start to oxidate over time. Clean them regularly by using either acetone, sandpaper or both together.

Note: Do not touch the brass after cleaning it - this will ensure a slower oxidation process and require you to clean the contacts less.

## Bend back the current collector

To ensure contact between the Duckiebots contacts and the charging rails, the bending property of the current collector is used. Over time, the current collector will be bend towards the floor.

Regularly bend back the current collector to its original position to ensure a good contact.
