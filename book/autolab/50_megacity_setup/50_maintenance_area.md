# Building a maintenance area {#autocharging-maintenance-area status=beta}

Next, please build the whole maintenance area.

##Put together all tiles

Respect the constraints of Duckietown.

##Add April tags for every intersection

**Note down** all the **tag IDs** and their **positions** in your maintenance area - you will need them later on to define your map in the software.

##Add a red line after each charger

Directly at the beginning of the next tile after a charger, add a red line. This red line is used to determine whether a Duckiebot is the first in a charger or not.

TODO add picture
